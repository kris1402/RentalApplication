## Results 
The task is to design a sample Database for a ski rental company using MS SQL Server technology. The project includes a user interface created in c#, for a rental company employee, registering rentals, entering employee and new equipment data. At this point, the system can be used as a Beta version, allowing to test the implemented solution in real conditions.
